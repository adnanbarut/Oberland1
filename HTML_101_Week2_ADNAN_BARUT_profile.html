      <h1><mark>My profile in short</mark></h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Adnan BARUT</strong>.
          <div>
            If I am to give super-brief details about myself, here you go...
            <br>
            <br>I was born in Antalya in 1975 and I'm 44 years old. By profession I'm an English teacher.
            <br><i>(By the way, you can see a lovely scenery from Antalya at the bottom of this page.)</i>
            <br>I've been in Switzerland for more than a year now and I'm evaluating the options to cling to life here. 
           </div>

      <h4><mark>Any interests or hobbies?</mark></h3>
        <p>Well, yes, I naturally have a few...
           <br>Being surrounded with mountains, I can't stop myself hiking up every now and then. 
          <br>Every week <i>-and as long as the weather allows-</i> I try to hike up a different peak and apparently it's turning into a habit now. 
           <br>Other than that I love reading about different cultures and traditions of the world. 
           <br>Oh, I should mention seeing the latest movies as well :).
